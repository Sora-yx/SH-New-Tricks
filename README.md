## About

This is a mod that tweaks the moveset of the characters and replace or add new actions:

- SA1 Spin Dash (toggleable for each speed character) replace Rocket Accel.
- Amy Propeller Tweaks - Increase duration and speed depending on your current speed level, you can also trigger it while falling to do some fancy speed combo.
- Flight Tweaks - Make the fly duration and speed faster as your fly level raise
- Triangle Dive Tweaks - Duration increase as the power level raise, you can also trigger it while falling


Some small QOL:
- Amy Tornado - Make Amy able to move when creating a Tornado mid air
- Wide Power Attack - Make Power characters able to move when firing Wide Power attack.


Features are all optional, so you can toggle whatever you like.

That's pretty much it for now.
